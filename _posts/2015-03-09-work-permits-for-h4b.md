<a href="http://www.uscis.gov/news/dhs-extends-eligibility-employment-authorization-certain-h-4-dependent-spouses-h-1b-nonimmigrants-seeking-employment-based-lawful-permanent-residence">Federal government announced</a> earlier this year that spouses of H1B visa holders like yours truly will be eligible to work in these United States.

I felt like writing to thank those who lobbied for this change and indeed the US government for realizing that:

- Majority of the H4B visa holders are women.
- They are highly educated.
- They produce way more jobs for the market than they consume.

If you go through [this](http://www.marieclaire.com/politics/news/a8218/h4-visa-debate-beyond-borders) article, you might read between the lines and draw similar conclusions as I point out above.
