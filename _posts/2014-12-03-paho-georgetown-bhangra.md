title: PAHO and Georgetown Bhangra
---
This year I had the opportunity of organizing two [Bhangra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhangra_(dance)) performances.

## Georgetown University
I helped setup a flash mob for the [International Political Economy Society 2014](https://ncgg.princeton.edu/IPES/program2014.php) Conference Dinner.

## Pan American Health Organization
I co-coreographed a performance for the PAHO got Talent, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwkA9ClNkhI) is the YouTube video, and yes we did win.
