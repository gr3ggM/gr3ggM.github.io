Here's how I spend my after hours

### Dancing
I've been involved in dancing  in some form most of my life, living in the greater Washington D.C. area I've recently had the opportunity to get involved in [choreographing some dance performances]({%post_url 2014-12-03-paho-georgetown-bhangra %}).

### Volunteering
I help out at the [National Gurdwara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Gurdwara) kitchen, for more information please [visit the Gurdwara](https://www.google.com/maps/place/3801+Massachusetts+Ave+NW,+Washington,+D.C.,+DC+20016/) if you are in the Washington D.C. area.

### MOOCs
[I sign up for more online classes than I can complete](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratibhadutta), some of them have been quite challenging and rewarding. I see myself taking these classes long into my career in HR and where ever life takes me, I truly believe for me conventional higher education today has been transformed forever.
