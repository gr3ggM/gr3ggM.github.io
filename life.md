I grew up in Woodley, Reading UK and from an early age (10) was interested in computing. I was either playing games or trying to configure Windows to my liking, computing has always been there. I obtained my degree in Applied Computing in 2007 and have worked in the communication and data industry for 15 years. 

Here's how I spend my after hours

### Family
Post work I'm and husband and a farther, living in Warfield, Bracknell UK. I spend my weekends with my family going to parks, events and walks.
